Strings in Java
---------------------
String is a non-primitive datatype because its references a memory loaction where data is stored in the heap memory 
(or String Constant Pool) i.e, it references to a memory where an object is actually placed.
And thus the variable of a non-primitive data type is also called reference data types or object reference variable.
This object reference variable lives on the stack memory and the object to which it points always lives on the heap memory.
The stack holds a pointer to the object on the heap.
Thus all non-primitive data types are simply called objects which are created by instantiating a class.
===================
2)String is the sequence of characters or say, string is an array of characters.
For eg: 
->char[] c={'d','e','e','p','a','k'};
->String s= new String(c);
is same as ..... String s ="deepak";
===================================
3)String is a class
synax:public final class String extends object implememts charsequence,serializable and comparable
{
block of statements in string format
}
-->Serializable interface is used when we need to store a copy of the object and send them to another process which runs on the same system or over the network.
->Compareable interface is used to order the objects of the class.If has only one method i.e, compareTo().
=================================
4)we can create string class object by String s= new String(); 
It will create an Immutable object.
================================================
To create String there are three classes:
i)String
ii)StringBuffer
iii)StringBuilder
=============================================
String Constant Pool (or String Literal Pool) is an area in heap, memory where java stores String literal values.
